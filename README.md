# react-parcel-starter and coffee drinking game 

A React parcel starter project

This repo implements a "coffee drinking game". You can click on the coffee cups to empty them and the coffee cups fill faster with time. 

The serviceworker has not been fully tested yet but I guess it should work as it doesn't anything extrodinary difficult. 

## QuickStart

You can skip installing and just go to the *dist directory* and run something like  
```bash
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 1234
```
to run the game at **localhost:1234** . 

## ServiceWorker - how to install it 

The serviceworker is in the serviceworker directory inside the src directory. It was manually added after the distribution was build with **npm run build**.
The register.js for registering the serviceworker was added with script-tags. The serviceworker.js file was copied into the *dist* directory.

You can check if the serviceworker is installed on the Chrome browser by *chrome://inspect/#service-workers*.

## Usage

Clone the repo and and do as being told in the **builiding section**. Afterwards the program or game should run on 
*localhost:1234* . Have fun with it!
